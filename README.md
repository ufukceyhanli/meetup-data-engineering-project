# meetup-data-engineering-project

Meetup is an application that brings together individuals with shared interests, fostering a platform for them to connect and enjoy meaningful interactions. The primary objective of this project is to handle a substantial volume of JSON files containing vital information about Meetup events, groups, and meetings. These files are securely stored within an AWS S3 bucket. To efficiently manage this data, the project employs Pyspark, an effective tool for processing raw data, and subsequently loads it into the Databricks SQL warehouse. For the purpose of data transformation, the project utilizes dbt, a powerful tool for managing the data lifecycle. The final step involves the use of PowerBI to craft visually appealing and insightful data visualizations.
